# Conkagar
My first personal project (2012) tried to do a lot of things, none particularly well.  However, I credit this project for a lot of my preliminary knowledge of object oriented programming and data structures.  The game features a good fighting system, some rough building mechanics, and crafting.  Most importantly, there is a rather fun quest against King Conkagar.
